# nightly
Nightly client source code is now released scince I will not be developing this client anymore. Thanks to everyone who was in the discord server of the client btw.

The utils and some of the bypasses are skided (and the array list animation scince i am too trash to get the animation to work on the array list)

Skided from: Rise, Exhibition, Tenacity, Vestige, Flap and more.

The only thing that is not skided is the clickgui, but its made on exeo's base.

If you want to read why I am leaving you can check the discord server: https://discord.gg/UDZTFeveAS (I am to lazy to upload a screenshot of the message to imgur lol)

Idk how to upload this whole thing onto github so heres the downlaod link, it should be eclipse ready, make sure to use jdk 8. https://mega.nz/file/0VpG2ALL#XemVcfszm0gubTyCCyZdJqAIh8J6vmks9jdKIq1k2M8
